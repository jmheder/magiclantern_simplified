Basic workflow, notes for automating in the future.

Determine which rom is code, which assets
Use qemu to get rom copy regions
Determine load addresses
Determine arch for code rom
Load code rom, set r-x
Load asset rom, set r--
Load copy regions, set rwx (or maybe r-x?  If Canon never writes after the initial copy this may be better)
    This is complicated by cache/uncache bits (more generally, the page type)
        How to get this before loading regions?
Set sensible analysis options
Define known data types
Define functions for known stubs, with param and return types (helps analysis)
Define entry point
Increase analysis timeout
Do headless analysis (allegedly GUI load is significant on wimpy machines)

77D walkthrough

(trying to find strings shared across old and new cams,
that distinguish between asset and code roms)
rom0 is code, strings:
    DRYOS version
    DRYOS PANIC
    handler
    create a task
    TakeSemaphore

rom1 is assets, strings:
    Copyright-Info
    <MENU>
    batteries
    activate movie
    Autofocus
